		[In a Nietzschean life without God, nature has lost its foundation.]
	</div>

	<div class="info2">
		&nbsp; &nbsp; A resolution of this human paradox <br> for nature can only be achieved on a worldly plane through direct and <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unflinching confrontation with the negative side of life.
	</div>

	<div class="info3">
	 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Fifth Symphony, <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as a case in point, <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; presents a life crisis in the abstract, <br>&nbsp; explores its manifestations, and then overcomes its tragic nature through a courageous struggle with its most destructive aspects.
	</div>

	<div class="info4">
 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 	Mahler avoids explicit extra-musical subjects, 
 	<br>
 	having openly disavowed programmatic content, he now concentrates on purely abstract music-making, 
 	<br>
 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 	he no longer expresses nature as the quintessence of worldly existence, 
 	<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
	or otherworldly spiritualism or pantheism, as a path to ultimate truth.
	</div>

	<div class="info5">
	A central philosophical concept seems pervasive,
	<br>
 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 	a search for redemption from suffering. 
 	<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 	Within this conceptual framework, 
	<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mahler infuses the music with implicit psychological and philosophical overtones, 
 	<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
    in an exploration of the human subconscious.
	</div>

	<div class="info6">
	Mahler moves from the sublime to the ridiculous, 
	<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	the mournful to the outraged, 
	<br>
 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  	the calm to the storm, 
  	<br>
   	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	sometimes without the slightest warning. 
	</div>

	<div class="info7">
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
	Form follows function here, 
	<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
	always in the service of the musicâ€™s dramatic nature. 
	<br><br>
	Diversions from classical form, enable Mahler to express a myriad of emotions that appear in disarray, 
	<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
	their chaotic manner of presentation, mirroring the confusions and disaffection of modern life.
